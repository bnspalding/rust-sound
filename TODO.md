# TODO

- write up a semi-formal spec for the library to reorganize my thoughts

- start with reconstructing the foundational data structures: Phoneme,
  Monosegments & Disegments, Segment, root features & autosegmental features

- possibly update data files to reflect changes in my model of features

- manifest: add description
