//! Phonological unit of speech sound.
//!
//! Phonemes are the abstract blocks into which listeners divide and
//! categorize speech sounds. They are associated with particular languages
//! and vary from accent to accent. This package assumes that the symbolic
//! representation for a phoneme is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

use crate::features::Segment;

///A Phoneme is a unit of speech sound.
///
///Most phonemes are monosegments, like 'ɪ' or 't'. However, there are also
///instances where a single phoneme behaves like a sequence of two phonological
///segments (a disegment), as in the cases of diphthongs ('a͡ɪ') or affricates
///('t͡ʃ'). This representation does away with the need for a 'delrel' feature
///on segments.
